# Ex.Name:Write a C++ Program to read two sequence of character  value from the keyboard and display the value on the monitor?
## Date: 02-09-2025
## Aim:
To write a C++ program that reads two sequences of character values (strings) from the keyboard and displays them on the monitor.

## Algorithm:
1.Start the program.

2.Declare two string variables to store the character sequences.

3.Read input from the user for both strings using cin.

4.Display the values of the two strings using cout.

5.Stop the program.
## Program:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    string first,second;
    cin >> first >> second;
    
    cout << "First Value is:" << first << endl;
    cout << "Second Value is:" << second << endl;
}
```

## Result:
Thus the Program to read two sequence of character  value from the keyboard and display the value on the monitor has been executed successfully
